Some days I wake up and I’m ok
Most days I force myself to get out of the bed
I feel….

Lost

I’m trying to figure out my way in this world
I know it won’t happen overnight
But it’s hard
So hard
I’m losing myself in the process
I feel like I’ve been so down and out so long that I really don’t know how to get out of it
Social media may show that I have my shit together
But I’m slowly breaking apart
Don’t know where I’m going
Don’t know who I am
It’s been a long time where I felt nonexistent 
I feel…

Ugly

There’s a huge stigma that it’s not what’s on the outside that matters, its what’s on the inside.
I am a beautiful person
I know I am
I just wish I believed it
I wished my outside matched my inside
I wish I didn’t feel like this
But I can’t control it
Not yet
I will get better


Just not today….
